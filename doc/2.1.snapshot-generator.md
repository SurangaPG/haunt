# Snapshot generator

The snapshot generator is used to visit a set of pages as described in a 
manifest file and generate screenshots for it. 
See the "1.1 manifest file" chapter for more info. 

## Haunt CLI 

The cli currently offers a basic command. 

NOTE that this makes a few assumptions based on basic defaults. 
If you need more granular control see the custom implementation
below. 

## Custom implementation

The snapshot generator only needs a few things to function. These 
can be injected into the constructor. 

Basic construction: 
``` 
  /**
   * @var \surangapg\Haunt\Manifest\ManifestInterface $manifest
   */
  $manifest;

  /**
   * @var \surangapg\Haunt\Output\Structure\OutputStructureInterface $outputStructure
   */
  $outputStructure;
  
  /**
   * @param \Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface $output
   */

   $snapshotGenerator = new \surangapg\Haunt\Generator\SnapshotGenerator($manifest, $outputStructure, $output);
``` 

Once you have the generator class you can get a list of screenshots 
via the generate command. 

``` 
    $snapshotGenerator->generate('https://wikipedia.com');
``` 

This will write out a full set of screenshots to the filesystem. 
Also a "meta.yml" file (depending on the output interface) will 
be added with some metadata about the set.

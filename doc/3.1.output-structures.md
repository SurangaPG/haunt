# Output structures 

The output is handled by a output structure. Which is responsible for 
generating the names for the different files on the filesystem.

This allows filesets of various forms to be mapped onto manifests
and vice versa. Making it easier for generators to read in data 
from various snapshot sources. 

## Default implementation

The default implementation is the DefaultFolderOutputStructure which 
basically splits everything into nested folders.

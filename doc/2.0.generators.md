# Generators

Haunt consists of a few larger generators. Each of them with a very specific 
goal within the chain. These generators can be used to build the various sets 
of data output. Either image files or yml files. 

## Snapshot generator

The snapshot generator is used to visit a set of pages as described in a 
manifest file and generate screenshots for it.

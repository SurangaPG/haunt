# The manifest file

A manifest file is a yml file containing the data about all the url's that 
should be visited. 

## Basic usage

Example file: 
``` 
info:
  name: 'full-regression'
default_variations:
  sizes:
    xs:
      width: 400
      height: 1200
    lg:
      width: 1200
      height: 1200
  visitors:
    - anonymous
paths:
  - '/wiki/Ap_(water)'
  
``` 
This file will tell any of the different generators what to expect from the 
provided data. It is used as a source piece of information for every of the 
steps. 

This example will expect data about the uri '/wiki/Ap_(water)' with the meta 
information "anonymous" at 2 different resolutions. 400x1200px and 1200x1200px

## Overwriting default settings

A single path can be differentiated by providing an array instead of a 
standard string. In this case the default_variations will be replaced 
with the data provided in the item. 
NOTE the "uri" key is required. 

``` 
info:
  name: 'full-regression'
default_variations:
  sizes:
    xs:
      width: 400
      height: 1200
    lg:
      width: 1200
      height: 1200
  visitors:
    - anonymous
paths:
  - '/wiki/Ap_(water)'
  - 
    uri: /
    sizes':
      sm':
        height': 10
        width: 10
    visitors:
      - anonymous
      - jan
      - karel
```
